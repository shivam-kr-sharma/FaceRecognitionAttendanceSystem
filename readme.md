# Face Recognition Attendance System

This repository contains the Python script for a face recognition-based attendance system. The system uses computer vision and face recognition technologies to automatically mark attendance by identifying individuals from images.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes the `face_recognition` library to detect and recognize faces.
- **Attendance Logging**: Automatically logs the attendance with timestamps in a CSV file.
- **Image Processing**: Uses OpenCV (`cv2`) for image processing tasks.

## Setup 
"data" is the path to the directory containing the images.
